A Google dinosaur game clone that I made using javascript, the p5play librarie and also electron.

Includes features such as:

- The ability to jump and sprint with the dinosaur.
- On ground and flying obstacles.
- Getting faster the longer the dinosaur stays alive.
- Simple interface with score and score record.
- Sound effects for jumping and dying.
- Day and night cycle.
